# Traffic Sign Classification System

An intelligent real-time traffic sign detection and classification system using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) with webcam integration.

## 🚦 Overview

This project implements an automated traffic sign recognition system that helps drivers identify and respond to road signs quickly and safely. By leveraging deep learning and real-time video processing, the system displays detected traffic signs directly on a screen, eliminating the need for manual sign checking while driving.

## ✨ Features

- **Real-Time Detection**: Continuous webcam-based monitoring and instant sign recognition
- **CNN Architecture**: Deep learning model for accurate multi-class traffic sign classification
- **Driver-Friendly Display**: Visual presentation of detected signs within driver's field of view
- **Cost-Effective**: Minimal hardware requirements compared to traditional systems
- **High Accuracy**: Robust classification across various traffic sign categories
- **Low Maintenance**: Reduced hardware complexity and maintenance overhead

## 🎯 Problem Solved

Traditional traffic sign recognition systems face several challenges:
- Incorrect predictions leading to safety concerns
- High hardware costs and installation expenses
- Significant maintenance requirements
- Driver distraction from manual sign checking

Our system addresses these issues through an efficient CNN-based approach with real-time processing capabilities.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Python**: Primary programming language
- **TensorFlow/Keras**: Deep learning framework for CNN implementation
- **OpenCV**: Computer vision library for webcam processing and image handling
- **NumPy**: Numerical computations
- **Matplotlib**: Visualization of results
- **Flask/Streamlit**: Web interface (optional)
